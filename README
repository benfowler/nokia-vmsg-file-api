This is a very basic tool to convert Nokia SMS export files into a more
usable format.  Presently, there are test cases to convert data into XML,
which is amenable to further processing using XSLT or XQuery.  There is
no command line interface; although a front end will be built in time.

Plans for the future: clean up the XML export tool to make it usable to
end users.  Add a Swing GUI to make it easy to consume a large pile of 
files and search and browse them in a sane way.
