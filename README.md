Overview
========

Here is some very basic Java code to convert Nokia SMS export files into a 
more usable format.  Presently, there are test cases to convert data into XML,
which is amenable to further processing using XSLT or XQuery.  There is
no command line interface; although a front end will be built in time.

Plans for the future: 

* Expand this, so that it can combine VCARD data with VMSG data to yield
  useful output (preferably programmatically)
* Have the tool process the output into something usable by the end user
